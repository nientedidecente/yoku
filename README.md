collection of wrapper classes to provide game engine functionalities to SFML.

## Target
the idea of this small lib is to provide something similar to what [Phaser3](https://phaser.io/phaser3) does with WebGl, a small 2D game engine with Scene and basic game functionalities.


**This is a learning exercise**, suggestions/ideas are welcome. 

## Examples
### Pong
